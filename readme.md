Logistic Regression Model Project

This project involves building and analyzing a logistic regression model using a dataset with various demographic, financial, and campaign-related attributes. The goal is to predict the outcome variable y (loan taken or not ) (binary categorical) based on the provided features.

Project Structure
The project includes the following components:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables
Model Development: Implementation of a logistic regression model to predict the target variable y (loan taken or not).
Model Evaluation: Evaluation metrics include accuracy and confusion matrix.

Requirements
Python 3.8+
Libraries:
